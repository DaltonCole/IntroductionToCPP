//Des: will establish an empty list of purchases, no name, and rand amount
//	of money between 4 and 250, and happiness from 0-100
//Pre: none
//Post: empties everything but money, gives money a value between 4-250

//Des: accepts arguments for name and money, sets purchases to 0
//Pre: none

//customer(const float mula, const string name)

//Des: returns true if the purchase was successful, also adds the item to 
//	list of purchases if true
//pre: none
//post: adds the sent string to the end of purchases array if possible
//	, if this happens, then true is returned	
//bool purchase(const string & item)

//Des: 50% change of buying something, if buying something then the customer
//	randomly picks and item from the business and buys it (if they have
//	enough money). If bought, the business increases it's funds by the
//	price of the item, and the customer loses that much money.
//	The item is then added to the customer's purchases array.
//	ALSO, if the purchase is sucessful, the customer's
//	happiness goes up by 15, otherwise it goes down by 10
//Pre: none

//string getName()

//Des: returns the value of money
//Pre: none
//Post: the value of money is returned
//float get money()

//Des: changes the money member variable
//Pre: none
//post: returns nothing, but changes the money member variable
//void setMoney(const int caching)

//Des: The customer throws a purchase at someone who attends the other business
//	(the item disipears). If the throw is successful, the perp's happiness
//	increases by 5 and the victums deceasses by 20
//Pre: the victum must be a customer of the other business
//Post: returns nothing, but changes the happiness of two customers and
//	changes one customer's purchases list
// void throw();

//Des: The customer steals an item from another customer if the customer
//	goes to the same business. The perp's happiness incrases by 25
//	and the victum's decreases by 20
//Pre: the victum must be of the same business
//Post: returns nothing, but changes product lists of two customers and
//	happiness of two customers
//void rob();

//Des: prints to the screen a sentence in this format:
//	<name> has $ <money> and purchases <item1.....>
//pre: none
//post: returns nothing, but prints to the screen the member variables
//	in a readable format
