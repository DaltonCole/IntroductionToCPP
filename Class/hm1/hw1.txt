//Description: Assignment 01- make three algorithms

	1.Flat Tire
Step 1: Get out of the car
Step 2: Figure out which tire went flat
Step 3: Take out a lug-wrench, a jack, and an inflated spare tire from the
trunk, if these do not exist, call for help and skip all of the following
steps
Step 4: Put jack in the jack spot near the flat tire
Step 5: Raise the car by using the lever on the jack
Step 6: use the lug-wrench to undo the bolts on the flat tire by turning in
a counter-clockwise direction
Step 7: Remove tire from car using you manly (or feminim) muscels
Step 8: Place flat tire on groud in a horizontal position
Step 9: Place inflated spare tire where the flat tire once resigned
Step 10: Use the lug-wrench to bolt the bolts on the tire by turning the
wrench in a clockwise direction
Step 11: Lower the jack
Step 12: Remove the jack from the bottom of the car
Step 13: Take the flat tire, lug-wrench, and jack and place them in the
trunk in their original positions, with the flat taking the spot of the
inflatable tire
Step 14: Close trunk
Step 15: Enter vihicle
Step 16: Drive above the recommended speed limit, cussing verbally the whole
time, trying not to be late to class. (this step is only recommened)

	2. Decimal to Binary
Step 1: Create a decimal number line and a binary number line (just a
different area of the paper for each number system)
Step 2: Divide the decimal number by two, if there is a remaineder, add a 1
to the left side of the binary number, if not, add a 0
Step 3: Divide the new decimal number by two, if there is a remainder, add a
1 to the left of the pre-existing number in the binary line, if not, add a 0
Step 4: Repeat step 3 until the decimal number reads <0
Step 5: The decimal number is now a binary number
	3. Adding Fractions togeather
Definitions:
- Numberator = the top number of a fraction
- Denominator = the bottom number of a fraction
- Least common multiple(lcm) = the lowest denominator that the two numbers have a
multiple in common
-The numberator of the first fraction shall be called N1 and the numerator of
the second fraction shall be called N2
-The denominator of the first fraction shall be called D1 and the
denominator of the second fraction shall be called D2
Step 1: Find the least common multiple for D1 and D2
Step 2: The number needed to create the lcm for D1 will be named x
Step 3: The number needed to create the lcm for D2 will be named y
step 4: Multiply N1 and D1 each by x to find the new N1 and D1
step 5: Multiply N2 and D2 each by y to find the new N2 and D2, at this
point D1 should equal D2, if not, go back to step 1
Step 6: Add N1 and N2 togeather to achive N3
Step 7: Place N3 over D1 to make a fraction 
Step 8: This fraction is now the two previous fractions added togeather
